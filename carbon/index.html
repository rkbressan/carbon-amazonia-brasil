        <p>Brazil is ready to resume its role in the fight against the climate crisis, protecting all our biomes,
            especially the Amazon Forest.<br>
            In our government, we were able to reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 80%, considerably reducing the
            emission of gases that cause global warming.
            <br>Now, let's fight for zero deforestation of the Amazon<br>Brazil and the planet need a living Amazon. A
            standing tree is worth more than tons of wood illegally
            extracted by those who think only of easy profit, at the expense of the deterioration of life on Earth.
        </p>

        <p>A river of clear waters is worth much more than all the gold extracted at the expense of mercury that kills
            wildlife and endangers human life.
            <br>When an indigenous child dies murdered by the greed of environmental predators, a part of humanity dies
            along
            with it.
            <br>Therefore, we will resume monitoring and surveillance of the Amazon, and combat any and all illegal
            activities – be it mining, mining, logging or improper agricultural occupation.
            <br>At the same time, we will promote the sustainable development of communities living in the Amazon
            region.
            Let's prove once again that it is possible to generate wealth without destroying the environment.
        </p>

        <p>We are open to international cooperation to preserve the Amazon, whether in the form of investment or
            scientific research.
            <br>But always under the leadership of Brazil, without ever renouncing our sovereignty.
            <br>We are committed to indigenous peoples, to the other forest peoples and to biodiversity. We want
            environmental pacification.
        </p>

        <p>We don't care about a war on the environment, but we're ready to defend you from any threat.</p>
