        <p>Brazil is ready to resume its role in the fight against the climate crisis, protecting all our biomes,
            especially the Amazon Forest.</p>
        <p>In our government, we were able to reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 80%, considerably reducing the
            emission of gases that cause global warming.</p>
        <p>Now, let's fight for zero deforestation of the Amazon</p>
        <p>Brazil and the planet need a living Amazon. A standing tree is worth more than tons of wood illegally
            extracted by those who think only of easy profit, at the expense of the deterioration of life on Earth.</p>
        <p>A river of clear waters is worth much more than all the gold extracted at the expense of mercury that kills
            wildlife and endangers human life.</p>
        <p>When an indigenous child dies murdered by the greed of environmental predators, a part of humanity dies along
            with it.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we will resume monitoring and surveillance of the Amazon, and combat any and all illegal
            activities – be it mining, mining, logging or improper agricultural occupation.</p>
        <p>At the same time, we will promote the sustainable development of communities living in the Amazon region.
            Let's prove once again that it is possible to generate wealth without destroying the environment.</p>
        <p>We are open to international cooperation to preserve the Amazon, whether in the form of investment or
            scientific research.</p>
        <p>But always under the leadership of Brazil, without ever renouncing our sovereignty.</p>
        <p>We are committed to indigenous peoples, to the other forest peoples and to biodiversity. We want
            environmental pacification.</p>
        <p>We don't care about a war on the environment, but we're ready to defend you from any threat.</p>

        <p>Norwegian Environment Minister Espen Barth Eide said 5 billion Norwegian kroner will be earmarked for the
            forest preservation fund.</p>
        <p><b>Norway announced, on Monday (31), that will resume financial aid against deforestation of the Amazônia in
                Brazil after lula's victory.</b> According to Norwegian Environment Minister Espen Barth Eide, 5 billion
            Norwegian kroner (about R$2.5 billion) will go to the Amazon rainforest preservation fund.</p>
        <p>"Regarding Lula, we observed that during the campaign, he emphasized the preservation of the Amazônia
            rainforest and the protection of the indigenous peoples of the Amazônia," the minister said.</p>
        <p>"That's why we look forward to getting in touch with their teams as soon as possible to prepare for the
            <b>resumption of historically positive collaboration</b> between Brazil and Norway," he added.
